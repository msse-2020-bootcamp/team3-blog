## Muhan Zhang is interviewed by Xudong Zhuang and here is the interview script!

## Where are you from?

Nanjing, China

## Where do you live?

Right in Nanjing

## Do you have any pets?

Nope. But I do have the intention to adopt a dog.

## What is your favorite food? What is your least favorite food?

My favorite food will always be the local delicacy in Nanjing - the hodgepodge noodles! This is a kind of noodle added with different kinds of ingredients, like meatballs, shredded pork and various green vegetables. 
I can choose which ingredient to put in. My least favorite food is any dish with celery. I wonder why so many people like it.

## Do you think we have something in common (that isnâ€™t the MSSE program)?

We both come from China! We both love music!

## Why do you choose the MSSE degree?

I was originally a student majoring in Chemistry, and I had a lot of experimental courses during undergraduate education. I felt the experiments are not the field I would like to immerse myself in. Sometimes, my classmates neglect the importance of theories behind. I found my mind gets carried away every time I deduce formulae and code on computer, where I finally settle down to. This major, Molecular Science and Software Engineering, contains everything I want to do. Also, I would like to use some cutting-edge tools to utilize on the boundaries!



## Additional info

Music taste - Mainly pop music, but eclectic taste. Some of my favorite artists: Faye Wong from China, Kacey Musgraves, Lorde, Utada Hikaru from Japan.

Sports - Not good at sports, but skilled in ping-pong.

Art skill(s) - Beginner of Pipa (a kind of traditioanl Chinese musical instrument).

Life - mainly nerdy, like to watch anime and play indie games, like to learn languages. Proficient in Japanese, and currently learning Korean and Arabian.
